# Classify-images-of-cats-and-dogs-with-Artificial-Intelligence
Convolutional neural network using the Keras API in TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs. 


Using a large and diverse dataset is crucial for the model to learn to classify images accurately, So i have upload 10000 images for dogs and cats  

Tune the hyperparameters: The performance of a machine learning model can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.
 In this case, some hyperparameters that i consider like tuning include the learning rate, the batch size, and the number of epochs.

I have tried different architectures for CNN to see if i can find one that performs better on my dataset to get better accuracy.

Using Data augmentation is a technique that can be used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of existing images. 
This is a helpful way to improve the model's generalization ability and reduce overfitting.

Preprocessing the data can often have a big impact on the performance of a machine learning model.
I did trying out different techniques such as normalization, standardization, or feature scaling to see if they improve the model's performance.
